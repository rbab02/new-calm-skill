It's not fun to feel that way. lets do some breathing. of course it will just be you breathing, as i do not breathe. breathe in... two... three... four... hold... two... three... four... release two... three... four... breathe in... two... three... four... hold... two... three... four... release... two... three... four...
You may be breathing fast and shallow. let's do some deep breathing to try to calm down. close your eyes and breathe in for three seconds. hold your breath for three seconds. now breaht out for three seconds. as you breathe, remember that you are breathing out stress and breathing in calm.
Lets do some muscle relaxation. breathe in while tensing the muscles in your feet. hold for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. now release the hold. breathe in and tense the muscles in your calves. hold 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. now breathe out and release.
That's not fun. lets scream out our stress together. three two one ahhhhhhhhhh.
